## Introduction: 

  
We came up with the idea of creating a platform called TALKATO to implement chat feature along with post adding and newsfeed.Along with it we tried to add some other necessities of the present time on the same platform like Games,Movies and songs,Blood Donation,Latest Weather,Latest Covid-19 stats .Our main motto is "Just one click away from world"
